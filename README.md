<h2><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">Knowledge Management</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">In this section on Knowledge Management, I wrote thinking about how the process could be, however, without knowing much about your day to day, therefore, they are just ideas based on the experience I have in this area. The documentation must permeate between the areas, so the person must participate in the project from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">I have the following points:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">1 - The technical writer must participate from the first meeting, in which the features and prototyping are defined (regardless of whether it is for the opensource or paid version). Here it would be interesting to have a type of "pre-documentation" in which it is explained in more detail what should be developed in each item/task. This helps with development, testing and documentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">2 - From this meeting, it is possible to define the priorities of each item, according to the type of version. As the paid version has more insight in this context, the tasks related to it should have higher priority, both for development and for documentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">3 - These tasks must be placed in a "queue" in some tool and must be clear to see in what status they are in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">For example: One column for "Waiting development" tasks, another for "Back-end development" tasks, another for "Front-end development", another column for the "Testing" phase, another column for "Documentation" and a final column for tasks "Completed and ready to enter the version".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">We can have separate boards for opensource and paid version and these must be classified/separated by sprint, so that it is clear to everyone which items should be included in each version (this is very important, otherwise it becomes a mess).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">4 - When the first meeting happened, the technical writer can already imagine what it will be necessary to document. The items that should appear in the release notes of the version may already have a draft explaining what each modification represents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">5 - When the task is in the test status, it is already possible to view what has been developed. At this point the technical writer can start the documentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">6 - Documentation can only be completed after testers have completed their tasks and changed the status of the task to documentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">7 - The documentation must be finalized and sent to someone to validate if it is ok or if it needs any modifications. Here can be support/dev/business people. Therefore, it may take a few more days after the test week to release the sprint (assuming everyone meets their deadlines, otherwise there may be delays).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">8 - Delivery of the product with the documentation ready according to the sprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light">9 - Start the flow for the other tasks.</span></p>
